This project is PoSWare (Point of Sales/Warehouse) system that demonstrate the functionality of a Point of Sale System.
We will also theorise how a physical deployment of the implementation would fare as well as the problems we faced during implementation with emphasis on the troubles converting what was designed to an actual implementation.

Our development process and outcomes will be assessed and our overall project management will be covered in the appropriate sections as we describe what we did to manage the project, what went right as well as what went wrong.

Any special features (such as our login system) will be mentioned in detail before we reflect on what we have done, and look forward to see what we could improve on.
